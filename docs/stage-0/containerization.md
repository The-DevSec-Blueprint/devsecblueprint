## Overview

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, making it easy to move the application between different environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Containers**: A standardized unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies.
- **Docker**: A popular platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Isolation**: Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.
- **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different environments, from a developer’s laptop to production.

## Why It Matters

Containers solve the problem of “it works on my machine” by ensuring that applications run the same regardless of where they’re deployed. This consistency is crucial for DevOps and DevSecOps, where applications need to be secure and portable across various environments.
