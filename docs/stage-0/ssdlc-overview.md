## Overview

The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (Secure SDLC) is an approach to software development that incorporates security practices into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Unlike the traditional SDLC, where security is often an afterthought, the Secure SDLC ensures that security is considered from the very beginning, reducing vulnerabilities and risks in the final product.

## Key Concepts

- **Security by Design**: Security considerations are integrated into the design phase, ensuring that the architecture is secure from the outset.
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the development process to mitigate risks.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Following guidelines and best practices to write code that is less prone to security flaws.
- **Security Testing**: Conducting regular security assessments, including static and dynamic analysis, to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**: After deployment, continuously monitor the application for security issues and update it as new threats emerge.

## Why It Matters

Incorporating security into every phase of the SDLC is critical for developing secure software. The Secure SDLC approach reduces the cost and effort associated with fixing security issues by addressing them early in the development process. This proactive approach helps prevent security breaches, protects user data, and ensures compliance with regulations.
