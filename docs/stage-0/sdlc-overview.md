## Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It involves multiple stages, including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Key Concepts

- **Planning**: Defining the projectâ€™s objectives, scope, and resources.
- **Analysis**: Understanding user requirements and system specifications.
- **Design**: Creating the architecture of the software system.
- **Implementation**: Writing and compiling the code.
- **Testing**: Verifying that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
- **Deployment**: Releasing the software for use in a production environment.
- **Maintenance**: Updating and improving the software post-release.

## Why It Matters

Understanding the SDLC is fundamental for anyone in software development. In a DevSecOps context, security considerations need to be embedded into every phase of the SDLC to ensure that the software is secure from the ground up.
