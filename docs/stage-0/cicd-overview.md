## Overview

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Itâ€™s a set of practices that enables developers to integrate code into a shared repository frequently, automatically test it, and deploy the application continuously.

## Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Regularly merging code changes into a shared repository to detect and fix issues early.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploying code changes to production after passing tests.
- **Automated Testing**: Ensuring that each code change is automatically tested to maintain quality.
- **Feedback Loops**: Rapid feedback from automated tests helps developers quickly identify and fix issues.

## Why It Matters

CI/CD practices reduce the time it takes to release new software features while ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state. This is critical for maintaining agility and responsiveness in software development.
