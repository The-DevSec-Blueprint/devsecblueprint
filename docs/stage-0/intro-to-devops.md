## Key Concepts

- **Collaboration**: DevOps fosters a culture of shared responsibility between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks reduces errors and speeds up processes.
- **Continuous Improvement**: DevOps encourages continuous learning and improvement.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Both development and operations teams are equally responsible for the success of the software.

## Why It Matters

DevOps transforms the traditional software development process, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared ownership. This is essential in a DevSecOps context, where security needs to be integrated into every phase of the development process.
