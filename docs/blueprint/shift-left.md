## 1. Introduction

- Definition of the "Shift Left" concept.
- Why shifting left is important in DevSecOps.

## 2. The Traditional Approach vs. Shift Left

- Security and testing as afterthoughts in the traditional approach.
- Shifting left: Moving security and testing earlier in the SDLC.

## 3. Benefits of Shifting Left

- Early identification of vulnerabilities.
- Reducing cost and effort of fixing security issues.
- Improving collaboration between development and security teams.

## 4. Practical Ways to Shift Left

- **Secure Coding Practices:** Educating developers on secure coding.
- **Automated Security Testing:** Integrating security tests into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Threat Modeling:** Conducting threat modeling early in the design phase.

## 5. Tools to Facilitate Shift Left

- Overview of tools that support early security testing and integration.
- Examples: Static code analysis, IaC scanning, dependency management.

## 6. Challenges of Shifting Left

- Cultural resistance to change.
- Ensuring security tools do not slow down development.

## 7. Projects to Explore

- **Shift Left in CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline that runs security checks at every stage.
- **Threat Modeling Workshop:** Conduct a workshop to create threat models for an application during the design phase.
- **Automated Testing Suite:** Build a suite of automated tests that include security tests for a sample application.

## 8. Key Takeaways

- Summary of the shift-left concept.
- Final thoughts on the importance of integrating security early.
