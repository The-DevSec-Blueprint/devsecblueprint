## Introduction

According to [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops), DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It's an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.

The beautiful thing about this is that it extends the principles of DevOps (collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery) by embedding security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), which will be covered later.

Ultimately, the goal is to shift security "left," or earlier, in the SDLC, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated before they can become critical issues.

Over time, DevSecOps has evolved as a response to the limitations of DevOps, where security was often an afterthought. It emerged from the need to include security in the agile and continuous delivery practices of DevOps, which allows organizations to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

### Why is it important?

Well, traditional security practices often cre√üate bottlenecks in the fast-paced world of DevOps, as they typically occur at the end of the development cycle. DevSecOps addresses this by incorporating security measures from the start, enabling faster and more secure software releases.

## Core Principles of DevSecOps

To get a better understanding of DevSecOps as a whole, you need to understand the core principles of DevSecOps. I've listed the **four** key principals that you need to understand below:

1. **Integration of Security**

   Security is integrated into every phase of the SDLC, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and monitoring. This holistic approach ensures that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of the development process.

2. **Automation**

   Automation is crucial in DevSecOps to ensure that security checks are consistently applied **without slowing down the development process**. Extra emphasis on not slowing down the development process. In addition, automated security tests, such as static code analysis and vulnerability scans, can and should be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early in the development lifecycle.

3. **Collaboration**

   DevSecOps fosters collaboration among development, security, and operations teams. It breaks down silos and encourages a shared responsibility for security, leading to a more cohesive and effective approach to software development and deployment.

4. **Continuous Feedback**

   Continuous feedback loops allow for real-time insights into the security posture of the application and infrastructure. This enables teams to quickly identify and remediate security issues as they arise.

## Recommended Resources

Before you move onto the next section, here are some of the various resources that I recommend you look into, such as certifications, books to read, and YouTube videos, to deepen your understanding of DevSecOps and its culture.

### Certifications

So I had to recommend certifications that you should get in order to transition into DevSecOps, here are the list of things that I would recommend (not in a specific order):

| Name                                     | Description | Level        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| CompTIA Security+                        |             | Beginner     |
| ComTIA Linux+                            |             | Beginner     |
| Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) |             | Intermediate |
| Certified DevSecOps Professional (CDP)   |             | Intermediate |
| Certified DevSecOps Expert (CDE)         |             | Expert       |
| ISC^2 CSSLP                              |             | Expert       |

If you're looking to go into the Cloud, then you should look into the following:

| Name                                | Description | Level        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| AWS Certified Developer - Associate |             | Beginner     |
| AWS Certified Security - Specialty  |             | Intermediate |
| AWS Certified DevOps Professional   |             | Expert       |
