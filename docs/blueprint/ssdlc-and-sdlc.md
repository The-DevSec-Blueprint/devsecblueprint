## The Role of DevSecOps in the SDLC

DevSecOps integrates security into each phase of the SDLC:

- **Planning:** Include security requirements and threat modeling.
- **Development:** Use secure coding practices and conduct code reviews.
- **Testing:** Perform automated security testing (SAST, DAST).
- **Deployment:** Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and container security tools.
- **Monitoring:** Implement continuous security monitoring and alerting. [Source: Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/development/devsecops-security-automation)
