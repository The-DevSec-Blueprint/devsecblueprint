OKAY! You've reached another exciting section of the blueprint - _Cloud DevSecOps Fundamentals_!

By now, you should have a solid grasp on the following concepts, all of which are necessary to fully understand the principles of Cloud DevSecOps:

1. DevOps
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
1. Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
1. Linux/Bash Scripting
1. CI/CD
1. Application Security
1. the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)
1. Shift-Left Security Practices

If you're confident with these, let’s move forward! If not, I **HIGHLY** suggest you revisit previous sections and experiment with the tools, platforms, and projects to get comfortable before diving into Cloud DevSecOps.

## Overview

According to [Puppet](https://puppet.com/blog/what-is-cloud-devsecops), _Cloud DevSecOps brings together development, security, and operations practices, specifically tailored for cloud-native environments._

The beauty of **Cloud DevSecOps** is that it extends the principles of DevSecOps to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure, emphasizing automation, security, and scalability at every layer of cloud infrastructure.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that security is embedded into the cloud development and deployment process from the very start, enabling continuous monitoring and protection of both infrastructure and applications.

Cloud DevSecOps has evolved as organizations transition to cloud environments, where the traditional security practices of on-premises infrastructure are no longer effective. In cloud environments, **automation**, **scalability**, and **shared responsibility** are critical components to reducing security risks while speeding up delivery.

### Why is Cloud DevSecOps important?

In traditional cloud setups, security practices were often reactive, occurring at the end of the development cycle. This caused delays and opened up opportunities for vulnerabilities to reach production. Cloud DevSecOps addresses this by incorporating security measures right from the design and infrastructure provisioning stages, reducing the time it takes to resolve issues and enabling secure cloud deployments.

## Core Principles of Cloud DevSecOps

To fully grasp Cloud DevSecOps, you need to understand the **four** core principles:

1. **Security as Code**

   Security is integrated into every aspect of the cloud infrastructure and application lifecycle using tools like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. This allows security checks, compliance enforcement, and monitoring to be automated, version-controlled, and repeatable.

2. **Automation**

   Automation is key in Cloud DevSecOps to ensure that security checks, like vulnerability scanning and compliance validation, are consistently applied across all cloud environments **without slowing down deployment**.

3. **Shared Responsibility**

   Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and customers share responsibility for securing cloud resources. In Cloud DevSecOps, teams need to understand and manage their side of the shared responsibility model, including application security, data protection, and identity management.

4. **Continuous Feedback and Monitoring**

   In cloud environments, continuous monitoring is essential for maintaining security. Cloud DevSecOps promotes real-time feedback through automated monitoring systems that detect and respond to threats in real-time.
