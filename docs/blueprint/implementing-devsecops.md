So now that you've learned a lot about DevSecOps, lets put the theory into practice (somewhat). This'll help you visualize what a pipeline "should" look like in theory, so that you can go off and build your own.

## Introduction

A well-designed DevSecOps pipeline ensures that security is integrated into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Rather than treating security as a separate or final step, a DevSecOps pipeline embeds security into every aspect of development, testing, and deployment.

In this section, weâ€™ll outline the critical stages a DevSecOps pipeline *should* include, formatted to match a Jenkins pipeline file. Each stage will have a corresponding security check to ensure that security is built into every phase of development, testing, and deployment.

## CI/CD Platforms You Should Look Into

Now, there are plenty of platforms that you could use to manage your code and build pipelines to deploy your applications. However, these are the three that I would recommend you look into and use:

| **Tool Name**                                       | **Description**                                                                                     | **Link**                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)**              | A widely used open-source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code.               | [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/) |
| **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** | A workflow automation platform integrated with GitHub repositories that supports CI/CD pipelines.     | [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) |
| **[GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)** | A tool that runs the jobs specified in GitLab CI/CD pipelines, supporting various environments.       | [gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) |
| **[Gitea Actions](https://gitea.com/gitea/actions)** | An open-source CI/CD platform built into Gitea for automating workflows and running pipelines.        | [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/gitea/actions) |

## Stages of a DevSecOps Pipeline (Jenkinsfile Format)

A **Jenkins pipeline** for DevSecOps typically involves the following stages, each representing a key step in the development lifecycle with integrated security checks.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        // Stage 1: Source Code Management
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                // Example: Checking out code from Git repository
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        // Stage 2: Static Analysis (SAST)
        stage('Static Code Analysis') {
            steps {
                // Example: Running SonarQube for SAST
                script {
                    sonarQubeEnv = "SonarQube"
                    withSonarQubeEnv(sonarQubeEnv) {
                        sh 'mvn clean verify sonar:sonar'
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Stage 3: Dependency Scanning
        stage('Dependency Scanning') {
            steps {
                // Example: Running OWASP Dependency-Check
                sh 'dependency-check.sh --project example --out . --scan .'
            }
        }

        // Stage 4: Build and Test
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Example: Building the application
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        // Stage 5: Dynamic Analysis (DAST)
        stage('Dynamic Security Testing') {
            steps {
                // Example: Running OWASP ZAP for DAST
                sh 'zap-cli start'
                sh 'zap-cli quick-scan http://localhost:8080'
            }
        }

        // Stage 6: Container Security
        stage('Container Security Scan') {
            steps {
                // Example: Running Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
                sh 'trivy image --format table --severity HIGH,CRITICAL your-docker-image:tag'
            }
        }

        // Stage 7: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
        stage('IaC Security Scan') {
            steps {
                // Example: Using Checkov to scan Terraform files for misconfigurations
                sh 'checkov --directory ./terraform-directory'
            }
        }

        // Stage 8: Deploy to Staging
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                // Example: Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster or other environment
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }

        // Stage 9: Continuous Monitoring (Runtime Security)
        stage('Runtime Security Monitoring') {
            steps {
                // Example: Setting up Falco to monitor containers in production
                sh 'falco --config /etc/falco/falco.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        always {
            // Example: Archiving reports and test results
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
            junit '**/target/test-*.xml'
        }
    }
}
```
