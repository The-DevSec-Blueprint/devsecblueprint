## 1. Introduction

- Definition of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment).
- Importance of CI/CD in modern software development.

## 2. The Basics of CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automating the integration and testing of code.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automating the release of code to staging environments.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automating the release of code to production environments.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Stages

- **Source Code Management:** Version control and branching strategies.
- **Build:** Compiling and building the application.
- **Testing:** Automated testing (unit, integration, security tests).
- **Deployment:** Automated deployment to environments.

## 4. Best Practices for CI/CD

- Using infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent environments.
- Implementing automated security checks in the pipeline.
- Monitoring and logging for CI/CD pipelines.

## 5. Security in CI/CD

- Integrating security checks (e.g., SAST, DAST, container scanning).
- Securing the pipeline itself (e.g., access controls, secret management).

## 6. Tools for CI/CD

- Popular CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
- Choosing the right tool for your project.

## 7. Challenges in Implementing CI/CD

- Handling complex workflows.
- Balancing speed and stability in the pipeline.

## 8. Projects to Explore

- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Implement a CI/CD pipeline that deploys infrastructure using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
- **Security Pipeline:** Integrate security tools like Trivy and SonarQube into an existing CI/CD pipeline.

## 9. Key Takeaways

- Summary of essential points.
- Final thoughts on the benefits of CI/CD.
